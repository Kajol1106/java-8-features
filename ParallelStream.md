  - it meant for utilizing multiple cores of the processor
  - normally any java code has one stream of processing, where it is executed sequentially. whereas by using paralled streams, we can divide the code into multiple streams that are executed in paralled on seprate cores and the final result is the combination of the individucal outcomes.
  - the order of execution, however is not under or control.
